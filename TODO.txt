               title
               book_stock (10 items left)
               -(30)+  Set inventory thresholds min/max items user can add item, so the product is not oversold
                       maybe limit the number of product by weight? like max items weight is 50kg
                       determine by seller or delivery vendor, ex: vendor only allowed max 100kg for each delivery
     b. click: -> add to cart -> store items in cache -> buy now
               -> check current item in cache and compare it with current item stock
               -> if item in cache less than current item stock
               -> than cannot proceed to buy, user must be update item qty
               -> than when we submit the order this step should be occured
                  -> reserved the item, not decrease item in warehouse (or maybe not???)
                     then, after payment succeed release the reserve items, than decrease the item in warehouse
               buy now -> same as above, the difference is we not store the items in cache
